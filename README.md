Driver Monitoring Service
The Driver Monitoring Service is a Node.js-based backend application designed to monitor driving events and generate alerts for unsafe driving behavior. It's built using the Express.js framework and utilizes the node-cron library for scheduling rule evaluations.

Features
Receive driving events from IoT devices and store them.
Evaluate driving events based on a predefined rule to generate alerts.
Store and retrieve alerts by unique ID.
Dynamic alert thresholds based on the location type.
Schedule rule evaluations every 5 minutes using node-cron.
Easily extensible for future rule enhancements.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm installed.
Knowledge of Node.js, Express.js, and basic API development.
Postman or a similar tool for testing API endpoints.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd driver-monitoring-service
Install project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up a configuration file (if needed) for environment-specific settings.

Usage
To start the Driver Monitoring Service, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The service will start and listen for incoming requests on the specified port (default is 3000).

API Endpoints
POST /event
This endpoint is used to send driving events from IoT devices to the service.

Example request body:

json
Copy code
{
  "timestamp": "2023-05-24T05:55:00+00:00",
  "is_driving_safe": true,
  "vehicle_id": "1234",
  "location_type": "highway"
}
GET /alert/{alert_id}
This endpoint retrieves an alert by its unique ID.

Example request:

sql
Copy code
GET /alert/unique-alert-id
Rule Engine
The rule engine evaluates driving events to generate alerts based on the following criteria:

There are at least X events in the past 5 minutes where is_driving_safe is false. X varies based on the location_type.
No alert has already been generated in the past 5 minutes for the same location_type.
Testing
To test the service, you can use Postman to send POST requests to /event and GET requests to /alert/{alert_id}. Verify that the service correctly receives events and generates alerts based on the rule engine.
